You are given a set  and  other sets.
Your job is to find whether set  is a strict superset of each of the  sets.

Print True, if  is a strict superset of each of the  sets. Otherwise, print False.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

Example
Set is a strict superset of set.
Set is not a strict superset of set.
Set is not a strict superset of set.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of set .
The second line contains integer , the number of other sets.
The next  lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

Constraints

Output Format

Print True if set  is a strict superset of all other  sets. Otherwise, print False.


>>>>>>

A = set(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(int(input())):
    X = set(map(int, input().split()))
    if A.issuperset(X) != True or len(A) == len(X): 
        print(False)
        break 
else: print(True)
